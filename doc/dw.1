.SH NAME
.PP
deconwolf \f[B]dw\f[R] is a tool for deconvolution of wide field
microscopy stacks.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
For deconvolution:
.PP
\f[B]dw\f[R] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]] file.tif psf.tif
.PP
or, for max projections over z:
.PP
\f[B]dw\f[R] maxproj file1.tif file1.tif \&...
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]--threads t\f[R]
Set the number of computational threads to use.
.TP
\f[B]--out file.tif\f[R]
Explicitly set the name of the output file.
By default the name of the input file prefixed by \f[C]dw_\f[R] will be
used.
.TP
\f[B]--prefix str\f[R]
Set the prefix to use for the output file.
An extra \f[C]_\f[R] will be appended to the str.
.TP
\f[B]--iterdump\f[R]
Save each iteration to disk, not only the final.
.TP
\f[B]--niterdump n\f[R]
Save every nth iteration to disk, including the final image.
.TP
\f[B]--iter n\f[R]
Set the number of iterations.
.TP
\f[B]--tilesize s\f[R]
Set the size (axial side length, in pixels) of the largest portion that
can be deconvolved at a time.
E.g., if s is 2048 any image larger than 2048 will be deconvolved in
tiles.
.TP
\f[B]--tilepad p\f[R]
Set how many pixels the tiles should overlap.
.TP
\f[B]--overwrite\f[R]
Overwrite the target if it exists.
.TP
\f[B]--bq n\f[R]
Border/edge handling.
n=0: no padding.
n=1: a compromise between memory/speed and quality.
n=2 default.
.TP
\f[B]--float\f[R]
Save the output using 32-bit floats, also turns off any scaling.
.TP
\f[B]--version\f[R], \f[B]-V\f[R]
Show version information and quit.
.TP
\f[B]--help\f[R]
Show a short help message and quit.
.TP
\f[B]--biggs b\f[R]
Set b to 0 to turn acceleration off, in that case dw reverts to the
standard Richardson-Lucy method.
.TP
\f[B]--psigma s\f[R]
Pre-process the image and the PSF by convolving it by a 3-D isotropic
Gaussian with sigma=s.
This acts as a low pass filter.
Have been found useful for very noisy image.
.TP
\f[B]maxproj\f[R]
With \f[I]maxproj\f[R] as the first argument deconwolf will create max
projections of all following tif files.
Output will be prefixed with \f[C]max_\f[R].
.SH While running
.PP
At normal verbosity deconwolf will put one green dot per FFT.
The fMSE value reported at each iteration is the Mean Squared Error
between the input image and the forward projected current guess
(i.e.\ the PSF convoved with the current guess).
.SH OUTPUT
.PP
Without specifying the output file name, the output file will be
prefixed with \f[C]dw_\f[R], e.g, if you deconvolve \f[C]file.tif\f[R]
the output file will be called \f[C]dw_file.tif\f[R].
Please pay attention to the log file that also will be created (as
\f[C]dw_file.tif.log.txt\f[R]).
.PP
Unless \f[B]--float\f[R] was specified the output images will be scaled
to use the full dynamic range of the 16 bit format.
The scaling factor can be found in the log file.

the Born-Wolf model.
