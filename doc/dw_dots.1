.SH NAME
.PP
deconwolf \f[B]dw\f[R] is a tool for deconvolution of wide field
microscopy stacks.
.PP
\f[B]dw dots\f[R] is the module that can be used to detect dots in tif
images and export them to a tsv file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]dw dots\f[R] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]] file1.tif file2.tif \&...
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]--LoG\f[R]
Pre-filter the image with a Laplacian of Gaussian filter.
Recommended for non-deconvolved images.
Sometimes good for deconvolved as well.
.TP
\f[B]--lsigma\f[R]
Lateral sigma for a Gaussian low pass filter or the LoG filter if
enabled.
.TP
\f[B]--asigma\f[R]
Axial sigma for a Gaussian low pass filter or the LoG filter if enabled.
.TP
\f[B]--overwrite\f[R]
If specified existing files will be overwritten.
.TP
\f[B]--threads t\f[R]
Set the number of computational threads to use.
.TP
\f[B]--fout file.tif\f[R]
Write out the filtered images (e.g.\ the LoG filtered image).
Only for debugging and only to be used when there is just one input
file.
.TP
\f[B]--ndots\f[R]
Specify the max amount of dots that should be exported.
.TP
\f[B]--help\f[R]
Show a brief help message
.TP
\f[B]--nthreads\f[R]
Specify the number of threads to use.
.TP
\f[B]--verbose\f[R]
Set the verbosity level.
.SH Method
.PP
\f[B]dw dots\f[R] will read one input image at a time and will perform
the following:
.IP \[bu] 2
Filter the image with either a Gaussian low pass filter or a LoG filter
using the values specified by \f[B]\[en]lsigma\f[R] and
\f[B]\[en]asigma\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Extract all local maxima.
.IP \[bu] 2
Sort the maxima according to the dot intensity.
.IP \[bu] 2
Calculate the FWHM value for each dot in the lateral plane (by
intersection).
.IP \[bu] 2
Write out at most \f[B]\[en]ndots\f[R] dots to a TSV file.
.SH INPUT
.PP
\f[B]dw dots\f[R] can read the same kind of files as \f[B]dw\f[R].
It does look for log files from deconwolf, and if one is found the input
image is rescaled according to the log file.
.SH OUTPUT
.PP
A TSV file will be generated per input file (\f[C].dots.tsv\f[R]) as
well as a log file (\f[C].dots.log.txt\f[R]).
The TSV file will be sorted by the dot intensities.
