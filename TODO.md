# Todo
 - [ ] Put some checks to see what arrays are not properly aligned and causes crashes with `-ftree-vectorize`
 - [ ] Documentation, examples and test data.
 - [ ] Flag to save one image after each iteration (to facilitate setting the number of iterations).
 - [ ] Demos, for example on the effect of the tiling.
 - [ ] Use tif tags to write meta data (also to transfer from input image).
 - [ ] Crash-safe writing of output images, write to temporary file and move when write is complete to avoid bad luck.
 - [ ] Highly parsable log file.
 - [ ] Proper logger.
 - [ ] Custom TIFF warning handle (not to overflow the console)
 - [ ] Include normal `Richardson-Lucy`
 - [ ] Make `FFTW_ESTIMATE` an option.
 - [ ] Double check the tiling weights using gradients and other patterns.
 - [ ] Give some love to deconwolf_batch.py (tiff vs tif, help mapping channels, install systemwide, etc)
 - [ ] Add information on the input image -- especially to detect if some pixels are saturated.
 - [ ] Make sure that something that makes sense happens when a Pyramidal tif is supplied.

## Done:
 - [x] Write down the image scaling to the log files.
 - [x] A higher level interface with facilities for handling and generation of PSFs. -- runPSFGenerator.py
 - [x] *Reuse* more tile sizes in order to keep the number of training sessions low.
 - [x] faster BigTIFF writes, examples exist in [matlab](https://github.com/rharkes/Fast_Tiff_Write/blob/master/Fast_BigTiff_Write.m), (In C++)[https://github.com/jkriege2/TinyTIFF], ... -- decided that it was not necessary
 - [x] Write as BigTIFF if the images don't fit into regular TIFF files.
 - [x] Does gomp use more threads than it should? -- It looks like gomp creates more threads than needed, however only the specified number of threads are active at the same time.
 - [x] Never load the full image in tile mode.
 - [x] Identity included, using `--tilesize 0`
 - [x] Reduce memory by using the identity `f(-x) = ifft(conj(fft(x))`
 - [x] Break out the image processing functions to separate library.
 - [x] Protect better against misuse.
 - [x] Support even-sized PSFs (kind of hack, solution by resizing)
 - [x] Check that it works on osx
 - [x] Cross-platform build-tool (meson).
 - [x] Possible to change the prefix with the `--prefix` flag.
 - [x] Refuse to run if output file already exist (unless `--overwrite`) with status `0`.
 - [x] Crop PSF also in x and y (individual crop per tile as well).
 - [x] Faster calculation of tiling weights.
 - [x] Report peak memory usage to log file.
 - [x] Automatic cropping of the PSF if it has too many stacks.
 - [x] Block mode for low memory systems, accessible through the options `--tilesize` and `--tilepad`
 - [x] Eliminate one or two arrays in the main loop to save memory.
 - [x] Use some kind of logging
 - [x] Argument parsing
 - [x] Proper automatic name on output file.
 - [x] Make use of symmetries to save memory?
 - [x] Save FFTW wisdom (saved to `./config/deconwolf/`)
 - [x] Identical results to matlab code.
